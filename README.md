# TrustML: Secure Your Machine Learning Models

TrustML is an open-source Rust-Python library designed to detect and defend against adversarial attacks on machine learning models. It aims to bridge the gap between security and machine learning by offering a fast, secure, and memory-safe solution to safeguard your models during the training phase.

It is a cutting-edge project aimed at developing tools to detect and defend against adversarial attacks on machine learning models. In the rapidly evolving field of AI and cybersecurity, adversarial attacks pose significant risks to model security, and this project leverages Rust's performance and safety features to build high-quality, secure solutions for real-world machine learning applications.

This repository provides a Rust-based detection tool that can be seamlessly integrated into Python-based ML projects, such as those using `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow`. The goal is to help machine learning engineers easily integrate security features into their models with minimal overhead.

## Key Features

- **Adversarial Attack Detection**: Detect potential adversarial attacks during training.
- **Rust-Powered Core**: Leverages the performance and safety of Rust for critical computations.
- **Python Integration**: Seamless compatibility with Python ML libraries like Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and contribute.

## Installation

TrustML is distributed as a Python package with a Rust backend. Follow these steps to set it up:

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Rust**: Latest stable version ([Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **Maturin**: Build and publish Rust-based Python extensions ([Install Maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/))

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trustml.git
   cd trustml
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build and install the library:
   ```bash
   cargo install maturin
   cd src
   maturin develop --release
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3
   >>> import trustml
   >>> print(dir(trustml))  # Should list available functions like `detect`
   ```

## Usage

TrustML provides an intuitive API for detecting adversarial attacks. Here is a basic example:

```python
import trustml

data = [0.1, 0.2, 0.9]
result = trustml.detect(data)
if result:
    print("Adversarial attack detected!")
else:
    print("No attack detected.")
```
